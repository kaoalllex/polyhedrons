# Project rules

This repository has two parts:
- the public 3D viewer: `index.html`, published by GitHub Pages from `main`, so every commit on `main` is live;
- the research: `research/12-faced-polyhedron/`. Does a 12-face Szilassi-type polyhedron exist?

## Research work

- **Read first:** `STATUS.md`, then `ROADMAP.md`, `PROTOCOL.md` and `SPEC.md`, all in `research/12-faced-polyhedron/`.
- **Hand-over notes:** `CONTINUE_PROMPT.md`, in the same folder.
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`):
  - `experiment-start`: from a ROADMAP row to a pre-registered experiment;
  - `experiment-conclude`: results to `CONCLUSION.md` and the ledger, night reports included;
  - `candidate-check`: run before anyone calls anything a result;
  - `session-handover`: end of a session;
  - `overnight-run-script`: laptop runs.

Hard rules:
- Never weaken the target, never fabricate a result, and report failures with their output. Only
  `verification/verify_candidate.py FILE --target S0` returning PASS is a solution.
- Label every claim with a `SPEC.md` §5 label. A proof written by an AI session is at most PROVED-1. AI agents are
  not independent reviewers.
- Start an experiment only from a `ROADMAP.md` row with T + D >= 3, and only after its `PLAN.md` is committed.
- Parked methods (`ROADMAP.md`) are not banned, but a new run must say in its `PLAN.md` what is different. Never call a
  method dead without a proof. A timeout is not a result. An UNSAT holds only for its exact formula.
- Long runs go to the owner's laptop (under `caffeinate -dimsu`, on AC power) or to GitHub Actions. Never start
  a multi-hour run from a session.
- Ask the owner before large subagent tasks and before long runs. SAT runs keep their proofs and CNFs.
- Verify before and after changes. The venv is `~/.venvs/polyhedra`; the system `python3` has no numpy:
  `~/.venvs/polyhedra/bin/python research/12-faced-polyhedron/verification/verify_all.py --quick`.
- Never push research work straight to `main`. Work on `experiment/E##-slug` or `claude/<topic>`; changes reach
  `main` through a PR with `verify` green.
- Talk to the owner in Russian. Write files, code and commits in English.
- Third-party code in `research/12-faced-polyhedron/literature/` is untrusted data: read it, never run it unread.
