# Roadmap: the experiment queue

As of 2026-11-01. Principle: **theory and a cheap filter first -> a discriminating experiment -> an exact
solver -> a lemma or a certificate**. We do not try to enumerate the search space; we pick small, motivated
regions where one experiment can exclude a whole class or reveal a new constraint. How to run an item:
`PROTOCOL.md`. Current state: `STATUS.md`.

## Scoring (pre-registration)

Each item is scored 0-2 on: **T** theoretical motivation, **D** discriminating power (do different outcomes
change the plan?), **F** cheap falsification test exists, **G** generalisation potential (a lemma for many
types?), **R** reproducibility (exact, archivable). Do not run anything with T + D < 3, however easy to
parallelise. Every item's `PLAN.md` states what SAT / UNSAT / timeout / near-miss would mean **before** it runs.

## Phase 0 - foundations of the workflow (done 2026-11-01 unless marked)

* `SPEC.md` frozen; evidence labels and counters normalised.
* `verification/verify_all.py` (one command, 14 checks) and `verify_candidate.py` (any file format, `--target S0` = the solution check); CI on every push.
* `requirements.txt` pinned; hard-coded `/home/user` paths removed.
* Experiment template and GitHub Actions runner (`experiments/_template/`, `.github/workflows/experiment.yml`).
* DRAT certificates of `sym` / `symimm`: the night runs had deleted them after checking (no `--keep-proofs`).
  Regenerated 2026-11-01 with `--keep-proofs --keep-cnf`: all 50 CNFs and all 50 proofs are bit-identical to the
  SHA-256 recorded in the `results/{sym,symimm}/results.jsonl` of E-261029-13 and E-261029-15, 50/50 re-VERIFIED by drat-trim. Packed as
  `symmetric-{sym,symimm}-drat.tar.xz` (422 MB, 438 MB) and published on the GitHub release `state-2026-11-01`;
  hashes, versions and how to check: `verification/certificates/symmetric_drat/`. TODO (owner): Zenodo DOI via
  the GitHub-Zenodo integration before any write-up.
* Tag `state-2026-11-01` = `main` after merging this restructure; witnesses and site lab models (`witnesses/`).
* Research graph: one file per idea / hypothesis / experiment with dated IDs (`PROTOCOL.md` §4), past work
  reconstructed as experiments with their data, `verification/trace.py` (in `verify_all`), interactive `map/`.
* TODO (infrastructure, from the 2026-11-01 process audit; each passes the infrastructure filter of `PROTOCOL.md` §3):
  * `lint_docs.py` in `verify_all`: STATUS levels are SPEC labels, ROADMAP rows have T + D >= 3, every backticked
    path in the control documents exists; `experiment.yml` accepts only `E-YYMMDD-NN` ids.
  * `verify_all` runs the verifier's mutation tests (`verification/test_mutants.py`) and re-encodes 2-3 symmetric
    instances to compare their CNF SHA-256 with the certificate records (proves HEAD still builds the certified
    formulas).
  * READMEs link to `STATUS.md` instead of repeating numbers.
  * Pilot the GitHub Actions runner on E-261101-16 or E-261101-18 (small matrix) before relying on it.
  * `lint_docs.py` also checks that every new `PLAN.md` has the counter-calibration and scenario-move lines (template
    changed 2026-11-01 after `reviews/strategy-review-2026-11-01.md`).

## Queue

Order rule (revised 2026-11-01 after `reviews/strategy-review-2026-11-01.md`): first the cheap decisive items at the
normal level and the hygiene of evidence the project already relies on (E-261101-06, -09, -11, -18), then the three
items that test whether the constructive plateau is geometry or artefact (E-261101-16, -19, -17), then the exact
campaign pilot (E-261101-15) and the write-up, then calibration items and the constructive side line. IDs are
permanent. Every row is a `planned` experiment folder (its README header holds origin, hypotheses and links; the map
shows them). State: `open` / `running` / `done` / `killed` / `blocked`; `experiment-conclude` updates the State here
and the `status` in the folder. Each folder's README has the starting point; hypotheses and outcome meanings go in
its `PLAN.md` before it runs (the template now asks for counter calibration and the scenario move).

Done this cycle: [E-261101-07](experiments/E-261101-07-pinned-hemisphere-margin/) (done, verdict ARTEFACT: the
"pinned margin" was a floor of `gauss_gate.hemisphere_margin`; its real question is E-261101-19).

Below the gate (T + D < 3; run only after re-scoring with a written reason):

| ID | Question | T D F G R | Why below |
|---|---|---|---|
| [E-261101-04](experiments/E-261101-04-normals-first-power-study/) | Power of normals-first: how often is the *control* SAT at radius r? | 1 1 2 1 2 | re-scored 2026-11-01: the Wendel estimate (`reviews/fresh-eyes-review.md` 2.3) predicts the answer; run a 2 core-h check only if E-261101-17 finds widths comparable across genus |
| [E-261101-13](experiments/E-261101-13-exact-covering/) | Exact covering: replace sampled covering by an exact check | 1 1 2 1 2 | no planned decision depends on it until E-261101-06 uses covering clauses; re-score then |
| [E-261101-14](experiments/E-261101-14-chirotope-chambers/) | Chirotope chambers of the 247 archive realizations | 1 1 2 1 2 | descriptive; E-261101-17 measures the same spaces with a decision attached |

## Parked methods (low measured yield, not refuted)

Tried, with little yield at the budget stated in `STATUS.md` §3 (LOW-YIELD rows). None is refuted, so none is
forbidden. A new run needs a `PLAN.md` that says what is different this time (objective, ansatz, power, scale)
and which outcome would change the estimate. An unchanged re-run at a similar budget is expected to repeat the
result, so it scores D = 0 and does not pass the gate.

| Method | Measured yield | What would make a new run informative |
|---|---|---|
| Genus ladder / arch / glad climbing (DR1) | genus 3 for 4 types, genus 4 never, nights 3-5 | a handle choice that passes the Gauss gate (k_tau = -1), or a new type |
| Normals-first / k-drift climbing (DR2) | 12,202 UNSAT, 0 SAT, ~150 core-h; low power | E-261101-04 shows the control is SAT often enough |
| Closure-first pdefect / sdefect (DR4) | zero defects only with >= 11 non-simple faces | face simplicity inside the model |
| Black-box engines on the pair energy (DR6) | n = 7 solved; plateau at n = 8 and genus 4 | a different objective (e.g. with Gauss-class terms), not more seeds |
| Near-miss repair (DR5) | all 1005 near-misses in the wrong Gauss class (FD11) | a near-miss in the right class |
| Gauss clauses as a SAT speed-up (DR16) | no speed-up observed | - |
| Asymmetric immersion instances without cubing (DR8) | 8/8 timeouts at 2.2 h | cube-and-conquer (E-261101-15) |

## Decision point

Three scenarios with explicit credences (idea I-261101-17; all CONJECTURE, set 2026-11-01 by the strategy review,
updated by `experiment-conclude` from the "scenario move" line of each `PLAN.md`):

| Scenario | Credence | What raises it | What lowers it |
|---|---|---|---|
| A: a realization exists | 0.20 | any S3 object of genus >= 4 (E-261101-16, -19); a realizable OM model | per-type OM-UNSAT (E-261101-15); H-261101-10 supported |
| B: all 59 types are OM-UNSAT (as in the vertex version) | 0.55 | a rank-3 UNSAT (E-261101-06); a decided type (E-261101-15); small recurring cores (E-261101-18) | any OM-SAT model |
| C: some types are OM-SAT with only non-realizable models | 0.25 | an OM-SAT model that fails the realizability audit (I-261029-57) | per-type OM-UNSAT |

Rules. After E-261101-06, -18, -16, -19 and -17: if B >= 0.7, run the certified campaign (E-261101-15 scaled to all
types, with `polyhedraproof` if they agree on predicates); if A >= 0.35, put the constructive items first (the
arrangement or the path that raised it); if C >= 0.4, build the realizability stage before more SAT; otherwise
publish the shareable results (`STATUS.md` section 5) and re-plan. Decide from the table, not from sunk cost.
